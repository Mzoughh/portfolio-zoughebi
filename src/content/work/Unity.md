    <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Roll-a-Ball Unity Tutorial Overview:</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 40px;">
        <li><strong>Creating a Unity Project:</strong> In the first step, you start by creating a new Unity project. Unity is a game development platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy games.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Up the Game Scene:</strong> You create an empty scene where the entire game will take place. A scene is like a level or environment where your game's content is situated.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating the Player-Controlled Ball:</strong> You import or create a 3D model of a ball. To make it interactive, you add a Rigidbody component, which handles the physics of the ball's movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding Collectible Objects:</strong> The game needs objects for the ball to collect, such as cubes. You add Collider components to these objects to manage collision detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementing a Collection System:</strong> You write a script that defines the rules for collecting objects. When the ball collides with a collectible object, it disappears, and the player's score increases.</li>
        <li><strong>Building the Game Environment:</strong> To create a visually appealing game, you add a plane to represent the ground and walls to define the boundaries of the play area.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Up the Camera:</strong> To provide the player with a view of the game, you configure a camera to follow the ball. This keeps the ball centered on the screen as the player moves it around.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding Lighting:</strong> You introduce lighting to the scene, which affects how the objects in the game are illuminated. Proper lighting enhances the game's visual quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> As a game developer, you make refinements to your project. This can include adjusting textures to enhance the game's appearance, adding sound effects to make it more engaging, or any other enhancements you desire.</li>
        <li><strong>Building and Testing:</strong> The game isn't complete until you build it for a specific platform (e.g., PC, mobile). You create a standalone version of the game and thoroughly test it to ensure it functions correctly and provides an enjoyable player experience.</li>
