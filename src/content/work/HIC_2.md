<div style="flex: 1;">
    <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Enhanced Learning Assistant with Augmented Reality</strong>: This idea involves creating an augmented reality application that functions as a learning assistant. Users would wear AR glasses and could interact with virtual information that overlays the real world. For example, when learning new skills, users could see instructions and tips floating in front of them, simplifying the learning process.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Augmented Reality for Medical Assistance</strong>: This idea focuses on the use of augmented reality to assist healthcare professionals. Doctors could use AR devices to obtain real-time information about patients, visualize crucial medical data directly in their field of vision, and even collaborate remotely with other experts to diagnose complex cases.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;"><strong>AR for Repair and Maintenance</strong>: In this concept, augmented reality would be used to enhance the skills of maintenance technicians. By wearing AR glasses, technicians could access repair diagrams and instructions directly in front of them, simplifying the maintenance process and reducing equipment downtime.</p>
