### Resume

This portfolio was crafted by utilizing an HTML/CSS template sourced from Astro. This platform facilitates the download of portfolios created by professional web designers, which can then be customized. Proficiency in HTML and CSS is a prerequisite for this task. The primary advantage of this approach lies in the ability to swiftly and effortlessly generate a responsive webpage. All articles are composed using the Markdown language. The portfolio consists of three main sections: the homepage, a works section, and an "about me" section, enabling the presentation of both works and personality.

To host this website, I employed a GitHub repository and the Versel platform. Furthermore, I acquired a domain name through Amen and connected it to the portfolio.


#### How to download the template and use it:


-1 Visit the Astro Website: Start by going to the Astro website at https://astro.build/.

-2 Find a Suitable Template: Explore the available templates on the website and choose one that matches the style and content you want to showcase.

-3 Check for Live Demo: Some templates offer live demos that you can preview to get a better sense of how they will look and function.

-4 Clone the GitHub Repository: To get the template, you'll need to clone the corresponding GitHub repository. Ensure that you have a GitHub account.

-5 Read the README: Inside the GitHub repository, you'll find a README file. This file contains valuable instructions on how to use and customize the template. Make sure to read it carefully.

-6 Install npm (Node Package Manager): Before you can proceed, you need to have npm installed. You can do this by running pip3 install npm.

-7 Initialize the Template: Use a command like "npm create astro@latest -- --template portfolio" to set up and initialize the chosen template. During this process, you may be asked if you want to create a Git repository.

-8 Use Template-Specific Commands: Depending on the template, there may be specific commands or scripts provided to help you work with and customize it. Refer to the README for guidance on using these commands.

Preview Locally: To see how your template looks and behaves locally, run the command npm run dev. This will start a local server on a personal port. The local server will automatically update whenever you save changes to your HTML and CSS files, similar to using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively acquire, set up, and customize an Astro template for your project.
