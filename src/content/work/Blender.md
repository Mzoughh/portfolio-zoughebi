### Learn how to use blender through Totoro modelisation



<div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;"> Blender is a 3D modeling software that allows you to bring your imagination to life. Thanks to the VAR master's program, I had the opportunity to explore this rich and fascinating world of 3D modeling. As part of this course, my project was to model an iconic character from Japanese culture: My Neighbor Totoro. To achieve this, I first imported an image to use as a reference and began modeling the character's body by extruding simple shapes. Once the body was modeled, I added details such as the eyes, mouth, ears, and whiskers. All this trnasformations are done with a mesh render as you could see bellow: </p>

    <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;">To enable animation, I created an armature and parented it to the body using the 'Ctrl + P' command after merging the body parts. To make our character more realistic, I applied a hair texture to the entire body. An animation mimicking a farewell gesture was created frame by frame for the arms in posing mode.

    <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;">To finish, I added lighting to the scene by placing spotlights and a floor. Finally, to enhance our rendering, I implemented camera movement, focusing on the character's face while panning and adding depth. I invite you to watch the initial render below. Enjoy!.</p>
