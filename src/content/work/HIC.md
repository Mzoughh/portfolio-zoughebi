### First Week: 
#### Affordances



<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; ">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style="margin-right: 50px; text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;">In this section, we will delve into the concept of affordances, using two everyday objects associated with new technologies as examples. <strong>A good affordance</strong> refers to an object's design being inherently intuitive for the user. <strong>Smartphones</strong>, in particular, exemplify exceptional affordance. Take, for instance, the latest iOS version, iOS 17, and its home screen. Here, every application is readily accessible via explicit shortcuts. Each icon is meticulously designed to convey a clear understanding of the linked application. Furthermore, the label for each application is conveniently placed below its respective icon. This exemplifies a prime instance of good affordance.</p>

    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style="margin-right: 50px; text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;">To further elucidate this notion, let's explore an example of <strong>poor affordance</strong>. Many older <strong>remote controls</strong> were overly complex, with designs that did not prioritize the primary function of the device. Numerous buttons lacked clear associations with specific actions. In most cases, users found themselves only utilizing a fraction of the remote's functionality.</p>

In essence, the stark contrast between the user-friendly design of smartphones and the perplexing interfaces of certain remote controls vividly illustrates the concept of affordance in the realm of everyday technology.


#### Gestalt Laws


<div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;"> <strong>Gestalt Laws</strong> are principles that encourage users to engage in desired actions. To illustrate this concept, let's consider the following scenario: Suppose we want to provide users with the option to switch between two comment sorting options, ‘Top Comment’ and 'Newest First.' Using a dropdown interface can be less user-friendly. With this approach, users must first click on the dropdown row and then select the desired filter. However, in cases where only two categories exist, the second approach enables users to switch with just a single click.Another example can be found in the use of color in website design. In this example, it becomes evident how the background color and text color must exhibit a significant level of contrast to ensure readability and user engagement. Furthermore, as in the first image, it is essential to adhere to logical color-coding rules, such as using red to indicate errors and green to signify correct actions.</p>

#### Dark Design Patterns

<div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;"> The presence of a red notification badge indicating the number of unread emails on your Mac computer can be considered a <strong>Dark Pattern</strong> in user interface design. Dark Patterns are deceptive or manipulative design choices that guide users into taking actions they might not want to take or make it difficult for them to make informed decisions. In this case, the red notification badge creates a sense of urgency and anxiety, nudging users to check their emails immediately. This can be psychologically manipulative, as it plays on the fear of missing out and disrupts the user's intended workflow. Dark Patterns like these prioritize engagement metrics over user well-being and can lead to compulsive behavior, which is not conducive to a positive user experience. Designers should aim for transparency and user empowerment rather than exploiting psychological triggers..</p>
</div>

<div style="flex: 1;">
        <p style=" text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;"> The ubiquitous pop-up requesting newsletter sign-up upon visiting a website is a classic example of a "Dark Pattern" in user interface design. These pop-ups often prioritize the website's marketing objectives over the user's experience by interrupting the browsing flow with an overlay that can be seen as invasive and unwelcome. To create a more user-friendly approach, designers should consider incorporating a clear and easily accessible option for users to close the pop-up without having to engage with the newsletter sign-up. This respects the user's autonomy, allowing them to decide whether or not to interact with the pop-up, resulting in a more positive and respectful user experience. Ultimately, transparent and user-centric design should be the goal, where users feel in control of their online interactions rather than pressured into actions they may not desire.</p>
